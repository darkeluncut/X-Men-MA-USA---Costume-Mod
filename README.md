X-Men MA [USA] - Costume Mod - 0.1 - Source

What is it:
Source of mod that adds a costume to Cyclops similar to the one of 2nd movie/2nd game.
Can be chosen in vs mode by pressing R1.

Works with psx-modding-toolchain (https://github.com/mateusfavarin/psx-modding-toolchain).

Of note:
It is supposed to be exploitable.
costume_map in modcostumes.c contains a table of R1 costumes for every character (0x0 - doesn't exist).
First _additional_ WAD.WAD inner file (file_00574) would fall into 0x274 and so on.

Provided as is.
